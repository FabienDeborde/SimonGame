# Simon Game

(Part of [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/) challenges)


A simple [Simon Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)) made using Jade(Pug), Sass (with bootstrap 4), and JavaScript (with jQuery). <br>

Start by pushing the **Start** button, the computer will highlight a color while playing a sound. <br>
Repeat what the computer shows you, the computer will add one color each time you repeat the combination correctly.<br>
If you fail to repeat the right combination, the computer will show it again to you.<br>

You win when you find the **_20th_** combination!

#### About the Strict Mode
When you activate the Strict Mode, if you fail to repeat the right combination, you loose the game and it resets.
